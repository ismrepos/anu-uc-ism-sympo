                <td>
                  Multi-species distribution modeling, which relate the occurrence of multiple species to environmental covariates, is an important tool for both predicting how a species community responds to the environment, and identifying important covariates driving species co-occurrences. In this talk, I introduce a recently developed tool for modeling species communities called Species Archetype Models (SAMs). SAMs use a finite mixture of regression model to cluster species with similar environmental responses to form “archetypal response groups”, and models these archetypal responses using a GLM, for instance.<br/>
                  A challenging part of using SAMs and finite mixture of regression models is variable selection, given the large number of possible candidate models. I consider using penalized likelihood methods to accomplish this, and propose two penalties called MIXGL2 and MIXGL1 which exploit the inherent grouped structure of the coefficients in SAMs. In doing so, both penalties are able to simultaneously remove a covariate from all components (archetypes). Selection consistency and oracle properties associated with the two penalties are shown, with simulations suggesting MIXGL2 and MIXGL1 outperform other penalties that do not take into account the grouped nature of the coefficients. The application of penalized SAMs is illustrated on a multi-species dataset collected from the Great Barrier Reef off the north-east coast of Australia.<br/>

                  By learning the PM2.5 readings and meteorological records from 2010–2015, the severity of PM2.5pollution in Beijing is quantified with a set of statistical measures. As PM2.5 concentration is highly influenced by meteorological conditions, we propose a statistical approach to adjust PM2.5concentration with respect to meteorological conditions, which can be used to monitor PM2.5pollution in a location. The adjusted monthly averages and percentiles are employed to test if the PM2.5 levels in Beijing have been lowered since China's State Council set up a pollution reduction target. The results of the testing reveal significant increases, rather than decreases, in the PM2.5concentrations in the years 2013 and 2014 as compared with those in year 2012. We conduct analyses on two quasi-experiments—the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in November 2014 and the annual winter heating—to gain insight into the impacts of emissions on PM2.5. The analyses lead to a conclusion that a fundamental shift from mainly coal-based energy consumption to much greener alternatives in Beijing and the surrounding North China Plain is the key to solving the PM2.5 problem in Beijing.<br/>
