                  　Multi-species distribution modeling, which relate the occurrence of multiple species to environmental covariates, is an important tool for both predicting how a species community responds to the environment, and identifying important covariates driving species co-occurrences. In this talk, I introduce a recently developed tool for modeling species communities called Species Archetype Models (SAMs). SAMs use a finite mixture of regression model to cluster species with similar environmental responses to form “archetypal response groups”, and models these archetypal responses using a GLM, for instance.<br/>
                  　A challenging part of using SAMs and finite mixture of regression models is variable selection, given the large number of possible candidate models. I consider using penalized likelihood methods to accomplish this, and propose two penalties called MIXGL2 and MIXGL1 which exploit the inherent grouped structure of the coefficients in SAMs. In doing so, both penalties are able to simultaneously remove a covariate from all components (archetypes). Selection consistency and oracle properties associated with the two penalties are shown, with simulations suggesting MIXGL2 and MIXGL1 outperform other penalties that do not take into account the grouped nature of the coefficients. The application of penalized SAMs is illustrated on a multi-species dataset collected from the Great Barrier Reef off the north-east coast of Australia.<br/>

                  　By learning the PM2.5 readings and meteorological records from 2010–2015, the severity of PM2.5pollution in Beijing is quantified with a set of statistical measures. As PM2.5 concentration is highly influenced by meteorological conditions, we propose a statistical approach to adjust PM2.5concentration with respect to meteorological conditions, which can be used to monitor PM2.5pollution in a location. The adjusted monthly averages and percentiles are employed to test if the PM2.5 levels in Beijing have been lowered since China's State Council set up a pollution reduction target. The results of the testing reveal significant increases, rather than decreases, in the PM2.5concentrations in the years 2013 and 2014 as compared with those in year 2012. We conduct analyses on two quasi-experiments—the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in November 2014 and the annual winter heating—to gain insight into the impacts of emissions on PM2.5. The analyses lead to a conclusion that a fundamental shift from mainly coal-based energy consumption to much greener alternatives in Beijing and the surrounding North China Plain is the key to solving the PM2.5 problem in Beijing.<br/>

                  　Inferring transition probabilities among ecological states is fundamental to community ecology because, based on Markovian dynamics models, these probabilities provide quantitative predictions about community composition and estimates of various properties that characterize community dynamics. Markov community models have been applied to sessile organisms because such models facilitate estimation of transition probabilities by tracking species occupancy at many fixed observation points over multiple periods of time. Estimation of transition probabilities of sessile communities seems easy in principle but may still be difficult in practice because resampling error (i.e., a failure to resample exactly the same location at fixed points) may cause significant estimation bias. Previous studies have developed novel analytical methods to correct for this estimation bias. However, they did not consider the local structure of community composition induced by the aggregated distribution of organisms that is typically observed in sessile assemblages and is very likely to affect observations.<br/>
                  　In this study, a multistate dynamic site occupancy model is developed which can be used to estimate transition probabilities while accounting for resampling errors associated with local community structure. The model applies a nonparametric multivariate kernel smoothing methodology to the latent occupancy component to estimate the local state composition near each observation point, which is assumed to determine the probability distribution of data conditional on the occurrence of resampling error. By using computer simulations, it is confirmed that an observation process that depends on local community structure may bias inferences about transition probabilities. By applying the proposed model to a real dataset of intertidal sessile communities, it is also shown that estimates of transition probabilities and of the properties of community dynamics may differ considerably when spatial dependence is taken into account. Results suggest the importance of accounting for resampling error and local community structure for developing management plans that are based on Markovian models. The proposed model provides a solution to this problem that is applicable to broad sessile communities. It can even accommodate an anisotropic spatial correlation of species composition, and may also serve as a basis for inferring complex nonlinear ecological dynamics.<br/>

                  Under what conditions does hybridization promote adaptive radiation?

                  　In adaptive radiation, many ecologically diverse species evolve in a single taxonomic group in relatively short term. For example, in the Lake Victoria in Africa, adaptive radiation of cichlid fish created about 500 endemic species within less than 100,000 years. Adaptive radiation typically occurs in the face of ecological opportunities that favor adaptation into various vacant ecological niches. Much evidence supports the view that adaptive radiation is driven by ecological speciation which is a mode of speciation where reproductive isolation between species develops through ecological differentiation. A longstanding question has been how genetic variation allowing rapid large-scale expansion of ecological traits has originated in adaptive radiations. Recently, growing body of empirical evidence suggests that homoploid hybridization may promote rapid ecological diversification in adaptive radiation. Hybridization can produce various novel genotypes within a few or tens of generations by mixing genes from different parental lineages. Such hybrid genotypes may facilitate evolutionary invasion into novel ecological niches, which can lead to formation of new species. However, it has also been argued that hybridization can cause merge of parental species into a single hybrid swarm or lead to population collapse by disturbing adaptation. Thus, the role of hybridization in causing adaptive radiation is still unclear and seems to vary depending on situations.<br/>
                  　The aim of this study is to reveal conditions in which hybridization promotes adaptive radiation. In this purpose, I developed an individual-based model to simulate adaptive radiation which is triggered by hybridization between two different lineages of a species. Individual-based model is a useful tool to simulate ecological and evolutionary dynamics of an ecosystem by tracking all individuals of organisms in the system. The model simulates the scenario that two parental lineages evolve independently in different sites for a certain period and then, they go into contact in another site where many ecological niches are available. Adaptive radiation takes place if evolution of many species utilizing various ecological niches occurs. To explore conditions under which hybridization promotes adaptive radiation, I conducted simulations with various conditions. Additionally, I simulated both scenarios that hybridization do and do not occur to test evolutionary roles of hybridization. Simulation results theoretically confirmed that hybridization can promote adaptive radiation and suggested that hybridization is particularly important in causing radiation when: (1) ecological niches are dissimilar one another, and (2) phenotypic effect size of mutations are small. Additionally, my simulation suggested that hybridization can promote radiation only when there is a moderate genetic distance between parental lineages. Contrarily, hybridization between highly genetically distant lineages tended to result in population collapse because excessive genotypic variation in hybrid populations disturbed adaptation. These results serve as the initial step toward theoretical understanding on evolutionary roles of homoploid hybridization.<br/>
